Supported architectures

- [x86_64/amd64](Dockerfile.amd64)
- [arm64](Dockerfile.arm64)

## Build

```sh
TAG=v1.20.3b1 make
```

### Versioning

Starting from v1.19.0 dev.boringcrypto branch has been moved to the main branch behind GOEXPERIMENT variable, so the image-build-base will be adding `GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto` to `scripts/go-build-static.sh` script, however the build will still retain the same versionining using the `<Go version>b<BoringCrypto version>` pattern.
